# Hands on session on Methods Hub
Hands-on session on [Methods Hub](https://methodshub.gesis.org/) at [MethodsNET conference 2025](https://methodsnet.org/conference/2nd-methodsnet-conference/).

## Abstract
The Methods Hub is an open-access platform designed to support social science researchers in discovering, accessing, understanding, and applying computational methods. This session introduces the Methods Hub as a portal for computational methods and demonstrates its core functionalities, guiding participants through the process of finding suitable methods, accessing them, and understanding their purpose. The session also highlights the utility of tutorials that it contains, serving as a step-by-step guide to demonstrate the application of a method for a concrete task. As an interactive session, the participants will select from predefined use case scenarios and corresponding tasks based on their interests. Participants will be grouped by the selected use case scenario and collaboratively explore relevant methods on the Methods Hub. They will be encouraged to discuss methodological options, make informed decisions, and carry out the assigned task using the available resources. Throughout the activity, the Methods Hub team will provide facilitation, technical support, and time management to ensure productive engagement. The session will conclude with a plenary discussion involving all participant groups and the Methods Hub team, reflecting on the rationale behind methodological choices, challenges encountered, and collaborative decision-making processes. This feedback on participants' experiences with the portal, its usability, strengths, limitations, and perceived relevance to their research needs, will shape the subsequent iterative refinements of the platform.
